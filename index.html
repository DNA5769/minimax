        <h1 class="gibhead">Welcome to Minimax's Fanclub</h1>
        <p class="gibpara">Hey there fellow Maximin's and soon to be Maximin's, this webpage is dedicated to the best youtuber to ever step on to the platform after James Charles and FurtadoGaming. Our main goal is to spread the word about such a great youtuber because the government doesn't want you to know about him. He isn't that popular becayse youtube had to shadowban him because if they didn't then everyone would spend all their time watching his vids and totally not because his upload schedule is wack and hurts the youtube algo.</p>

            <h1 class="gibhead">What?</h1>
            <p class="gibpara">Mini Max is a gaming/music youtube channel which consists of many entertaining videos. He doesn't make videos on any specific genre because Minimax is a very unique youtuber who tries new things out (...FIFA). His videos have cured depression of many becoming the second best selfcare video after Hellevator</p>

        <div>
            <h1 class="gibhead">Who?</h1>
            <p class="gibpara">Minimax's identity is unknown and hasn't been disclosed yet although his accent from his videos tells us that he's a retard who won't take hints and is obsessed with cupcakes. This totally isn't a personal opinion and is accepted by all Maximins. Sources (Aradhan) say that he may be disabled</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1 class="gibhead">More?</h1>
            <p class="gibpara">Maximin is the name given to the dedicated fans of Minimax. Minimax started making videos 4 years back and took a break. He recently came back and started making bangers again. He also made a video out of the gaming genre titled "Song 1" where he shows his music side, but most Maximins believe it was his ceiling fan</p>
