        <h1>Welcome to Minimax's Fanclub</h1>
        <p>Hey there fellow Maximin's and soon to be Maximin's, this webpage is dedicated to the best youtuber to ever step on to the platform after James Charles and FurtadoGaming. Our main goal is to spread the word about such a great youtuber because the government doesn't want you to know about him. He isn't that popular becayse youtube had to shadowban him because if they didn't then everyone would spend all their time watching his vids and totally not because his upload schedule is wack and hurts the youtube algo.</p>
